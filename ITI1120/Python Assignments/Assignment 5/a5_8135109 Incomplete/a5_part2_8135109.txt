2a)
function doesnâ€™t have a single loop. The function uses as many operations as needed without any multipliers.

2b)
Function has a single for loop. It operates n times, where n is the list length.

2c)
no loops. Functions use as many operations as needed without multipliers.

2d)
has a single for loop and therefore operates n times through the list, where n is list length.

2e)
has a triple nested for loop. the third loop operates, for example, 10,000 times per one 
occurrence of the second loop, which also operates 10,000 times per one occurrence of the
first loop, which also operates 10,000 times.
Therefore, it operates 10,000*10,000*10,000 = 1,000,000,000,000 times.
